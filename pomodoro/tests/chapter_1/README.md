# Chapter 1

This is about initializing your project as an `npm` package, then install some
dependencies to enable development in your project.

## Step 1 - npm init

Go to the root of the project and run `npm init -y` to initialize your project.

```
# Clone the project if you already haven't
# And change the directory to the root of the repository, then:
npm init -y
```

Feel free to edit the created `package.json` file with information about
yourself.

When ready, run the test, you should see green lights:
