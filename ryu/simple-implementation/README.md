# Ryu-Source-Simple

A simple implementation of the Ryu::Source for educational purposes

## Session 1

An over-simplified version of [Ryu::Source](https://metacpan.org/pod/Ryu::Source).

We're going to ignore all the bells and whistles that make `Ryu::Source` work
in real world application and implement a simplified version to help us understand
how the basics of the library works.

### To run the tests

```
make
```

## Session 2

- [X] Add `IO::Async` and make things work properly.

## Session 3

- [ ] Handle references gracefully
- [ ] Handle finishing the sources properly
- [ ] Some Reactive examples
- [ ] How to use in production code
- [ ] How to use for testing
